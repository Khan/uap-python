This is Khan Academy's fork of uap-python a Python user agent parser.
It has its own submodule uap-core which references the actual uap-core library,
we need this reference to get the regexes - which are actually used to parse
the user agents and updated to catch new user agents for new products. Since
this regexes may be updated, we need to update this library to reflect the changes.


To update:
1. cd uap-core && git pull origin master && cd ..
# This will pull the remote core module that has the most recent regexes for parsing
2. python update.py
# This will copy the regexes to the directory with the code
3. git commit -a -m "update the regexes to the most recent version"
4. git push
# This will record your changes to the "third party" library
5. Update and Deploy the submodule like you would always
